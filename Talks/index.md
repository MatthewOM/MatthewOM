### The Climate Pod (Feb 2020)
<p align="center">
John and I discuss our climate change paper with folks at the Climate Pod.

"...Then, we are joined by the University of Arizona's Dr. John J. Wiens and Cristian Román-Palacios, who recently published a study that made headlines for its analysis on the  potential extinction crisis looming if warming temperatures continue. They explain the major drivers behind extinction patterns and where plant and animal most likely to occur."
