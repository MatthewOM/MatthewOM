| 2016 (section A) | I liked my instructor, but I did not enjoy the class |
| 2016 (section A) | the teacher was great and the overall structure of the class was great as well |
| 2016 (section B) | Cristian is a really knowledgeable TA. There is a small language barrier, but he was able to convey his lessons to the best of his ability. |
| 2016 (section B) | Cristian is a wonderful person - very nice, very easy to talk to, but does not speak enough english to be teaching a course. I know that he was always trying to help us, but it was not adequate or on topic when he tried. It is a lose-lose situation because I'm sure he is uncomfortable when we ask questions he cannot understand or answer. However, he did always try. |
| 2016 (section B) | Cristian is very intelligent, that much is clear. But his lack of communication with students hurts the lab significantly. The way that assignments were graded didn't really seem to fit with rubrics on some occasions, and because of that students did not really know what was expected of them. There was a lot of trial and error that resulted in poorer grades in the beginning of the semester, which certainly could have been avoided. I do not think he was the right choice to being teaching a lab. |
| 2016 (section B) | great TA |
| 2016 (section B) | Instructor has a very thick accent and can be hard to understand but is willing to take the time to help you understand. |
| 2017 (section A) | Christian was great, but really hard to understand. I would almost always have to go through his lecture slides after class because I would have no idea what we learned in class. |
| 2017 (section A) | [...] Christian was a great teacher, very kind and respectful, he always explained things in different ways to make sure everyone understood and was always patient in explaining concepts to people and kept trying until they understood it. I think he was a hard grader though for reports. |
| 2017 (section A) | it was unfortunate, but it was very hard to understand this TA due to the accent. |

| 2018 (section A) | Great TA. One of the best I've had so far. Glad I had the opportunity to take Ecol Lab with Christian. |

| 2018 (section B) | Cristian was a good TA and was always willing to help me on an individual basis. |
| 2018 (section B) | Cristian was one of the best, if not the best TA I've had at the UofA. He knew the topic completely, always explained topics in depth, and always answered questions completely. |
| 2018 (section B) | I really liked the way this lab was organized. I knew what was expected of me and I felt good about the material when I went over a project. |
