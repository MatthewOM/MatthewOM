### What is the MSDS program?

the MS in Data Science program produces generations of professionals and researchers who have the knowledge, 
skill, and ability to engage in data science processes and work. This degree encompasses a blend of disciplines 
to address the grand challenges of today and the future. The MS in Data Science provides students the training 
they need in data collection, exploration, manipulation and storage, analysis, and presentation in order to navigate 
data-rich workplace environments.
