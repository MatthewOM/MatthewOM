### What courses should I take in my first year?

Please make sure you enroll the three core courses (INFO 520, INFO 523, INFO 526) during the first year of your program. 
Additionally, you are also expected to take 6 units of elective/certificate courses during the first year.


### How do I reach out to other folks in the program?

These mailing lists are only available to current students. We have four alternative lists that students can use to share information and interact.

Si_msdsmain@list.arizona.edu

Si_msdsonline@list.arizona.edu

Si_msdsglobal@list.arizona.edu

Si_allmsds@list.arizona.edu


### I'm interested in taking an elective that is not listed in the website

The list of courses that are pre-approved for our MSDS [website](https://ischool.arizona.edu/degree-requirements-%E2%80%93-ms-data-science) is 
not meant to be extensive. Depending on your interests, other courses that are offered by other departments might help achieve your personal
and academic goals in the program. If you see any courses that you might be interested in taking, that are not already approved in our website,
please email the relevant syllabus to Prof. Román-Palacios. He will review the contents of the course and will either approve the course or
suggest an alternative course to take.


### Do you want to schedule a zoom meeting with my advisor?

I'm happy to meet on Zoom and answer the any questions you might have about the MSDS program. Feel free to either send me an email asking for
a quick meeting (cromanpa94@arizona.edu) or directly schedule a meeting with me on [Calendly](https://calendly.com/cromanpa/15min).
